## Documentation
  If you are unfamiliar with vue, take a look at [official documentation here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). Here are some added things you need to know. We are using vue as well as vue-router. So that means the [App](src/App.vue) created from [main.js](src/main.js) loads different views/pages based on [routers](src/router/index.js). We also use the vuetify component library for styling.
