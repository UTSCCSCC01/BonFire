A good README.md is required for all software projects to assist with on-boarding
contributors. At minimum, your README should have the following sections - however
feel free to expand upon it!

● Motivation: provide a short detailed description of the motivation behind the project: what
is it, what problem(s) does it solve, and why it exists.

● Installation: provide a list of required tools/programs to run your project, and a procedure
for how to build and run your project.

● Contribution: describe the process for contributing to your project.

    ○ Do you use git flow?
    ○ What do you name your branches?
    ○ Do you use github issues or another ticketing website?
    ○ Do you use pull requests?
