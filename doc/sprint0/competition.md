Existing Competition: Trello (Trello.com/en)

How Does Our Product Differ:
    To understand how our product differs from the competition we must first understand the competition. Trello provides companies with a organized board to create "task assignments, timelines, productivity metrics, calendars, and more". They have
    customizable buttons to automate simple tasks like moving lists / scheduling teammate assignments. Trello was created with the modern workforce in mind - which is where it differs from our product. Bonfire is a organizational tool that is created with students in mind. It allows both students and professors to sign up and create spaces for themselves. Users who sign up as professors can create spaces for themselves and their students, and assign tasks to said students. They can monitor students progress with tasks and can relate to students in a 1-many capability. Students have options to create boards for themselves, and we offer several pre-set layouts for them to utilize.

Scenarios:
    - Teacher / Students (High School Organizational Work)
    - Professor / Students (University / College)
    - Tutor / Students (Create Homework for Students)

How the competition can threaten our market share:
    Competitors to our product, like Trello, can threaten the grip we will have on the educational market. In order to do this, however, they would need to spend a lot of resources they have on changing their target audience from business and organizations to education, and, they would alienize their already large base audience. Trello is used in large corporations, such as Google and Shopify, however, if they were to pander to educational institutions, these corporations would be dissatisfied that they are not getting premium treatment for the premium price they are paying. Users now would be dissatisfied and would move on to other applications. Trying to create one board for everyone is hard when you already have a very specific target audience, therefore, our product will most likely not be threatened by existing competition. Our competition saw more profit in focusing on the corporate side of organizational boards, allowing for us to take over the educational side of it.
If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios

  - Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
  Our users are specifically Students that want to be able to easily manage their school work. It would rely on Teachers adopting our platform, making it easier for students to use.
  - Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so? 
  The competitors didn't focus on the needs of students/teachers because they just wanted their product to satisfy the need for organizing tasks. The competition would need to spend a lot of resources in order to satisfy every class of users they have, also if they do not satisfy all the classes of their already existing user base, just trying to satisfy a specific class might cause other already existing users to be dissatisfied.
