Our team is composed of a group of 3rd year students that have known each other for quite some time. In order to organize ourselves for this assignment however, we formed a new discord server with well defined channels and categories where we actively perform relative discussions.

PDF Documents that needed to be worked are shared in a team drive folder and are pinned in the general chat for quick and easy access through discord. Any decisions are made in their respective file by jotting down all the respective ideas and expanding on each one while voting for the best. The priorities of tasks were set in a similar manner.

During the start of the sprint, we met everyday, but as the sprint progressed and the group became more aligned in our goals and product we stopped meeting as often.
Going forward, we should spend more time going through the sprint requirements individually and be prepared to take on some tasks or argue some points in the initial meeting.

### Story points and estimation

| Story points | How much work effort required | Dependecies|
|-----------|--------|------------
| 1 | <2 hours | None
| 2 | 1/2 day | Almost None
| 3 | <2 days | Couple
| 5 | <4 days |  More than a few
| 8 | <7 days |  A lot
| 13 | More than a week | Unknown

###### On average, it took 1 or 2 rounds of voting to come to consensus for the point estimation using planning poker. This may have been as a result of the chemistry of the group members. As a team, we agreed that scoring a story as 8 or 13 should be very rare and means the story should be broken down and worked on more than a single developer
