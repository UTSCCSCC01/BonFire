  Nest.js is a fully featured JavaScript framework for building web applications with the MVC design pattern. However, instead of using integrated views with Nest.js, we decided to use Vue as it is a more powerful front-end framework.

  Then we decided to use a MySQL database since we wanted a relational database. We also decided to use Prisma, a db ORM to connect our application to our database.
