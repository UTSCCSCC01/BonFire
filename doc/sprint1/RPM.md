# Release Planning Meeting

For our release goal, we want to complete all of our sprint tasks/epics, minimize all bugs and prepare the project visually.

The core features that need to be fully built out include;
- Users can create and manage their personal boards and use them to track tasks in a KanBan style (WRLD-17, WRLD-29, WRLD-33, WRLD-27)

- Students can join classrooms and get campsite boards where they can manage their assignment cards, see their due dates and other info in a Kanban style (WRLD-23, WRLD-145, WRLD-147)

- Teachers can create new classrooms and use a shareable link, which they can revoke at any time and use to invite students into their classroom. (WRLD-21, WRLD-22, WRLD-23, WRLD-25)

- Teachers can add assignments with due dates to their classroom for all classroom members to see. (WRLD-142, WRLD-145)
